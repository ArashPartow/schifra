#### Description
Schifra is a very robust, highly optimized and extremely configurable
Reed-Solomon error correcting code library for software applications
implemented in C++. Schifra supports standard, shortened and punctured
Reed-Solomon codes. It also has support for stacked product codes and
interleaving.

Schifra provides a concise, predictable and deterministic interface
which lends itself to easy and seamless integration into the
development of complex data communication projects requiring Reed-
Solomon error correcting code capabilities.
